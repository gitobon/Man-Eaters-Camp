        <h2>The Experience Man Eaters Camp </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
<strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> name really says it all, <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> pays tribute to the <strong>Tsavo camps</strong> of days gone by where well-to-do gentlemen visited the area for a <strong>hunting safari</strong> in the lap of luxury, luckily the only <strong>hunting safaris</strong> done these days are the tracking of wildlife to capture the best possible wildlife photograph however, the class and charm of lives on for the guests of the<strong> Man Eaters Camp,</strong> the safari camp&rsquo;s location in the Tsavo National Park gives visitors the benefit of being surrounded by an abundance of wildlife, without having to expect large numbers of tourists. The <strong>Man Eaters Tented Camp</strong> is known for its stunning marquee tents, world-class Maasai safari guides and trackers and arguably some of the best food in the Tsavo. The <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> staff is extremely attentive and will do all they can to make sure your stay is very memorable. The<strong> Man Eaters Camp</strong> guides and hosts have been known to share stories about the safari camp history by fireside when prompted, a wonderful way to end the day and learn about the history of <strong>tented camp - Man Eaters Camp</strong> is a nice mid-range tented accommodation facility that is found along the banks of the Tsavo River right in the middle of the <strong>Tsavo East National Park</strong>. The<strong> Man Eaters Camp</strong> was named after the many man eaters that occupied the National Park. One can use either road or air transport to get to the<strong> Man Eaters Safari Camp</strong> which is 232 kilometers from Nairobi and if you prefer to use road transport, it will take you approximately 7 hours to get to the camp and 2 hours if you are flying from Nairobi international airport to the <strong>Tsavo airstrip</strong> from where you will be transferred to the <strong>Man Eaters Lodge,</strong> it is also 1 kilometre off the Nairobi-Mombasa highway. The <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> which was set up at an old historical piece of land was re-opened in 2007, The <strong>Man Eaters&rsquo;</strong> lions used to hunt and kill the workers at the lunatic express in 1898. The two lions developed a taste for human blood and over a period of over 3 months, construction workers who were constructing the railway bridge over the <strong>Tsavo River</strong> were killed and there was an adaptation of the incident into a movie known as the <strong>Ghost and Darkness</strong>. <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> was reopened in 2007 and has been providing comfortable and luxurious accommodations to the different tourists who visit <strong>Tsavo National Park,</strong> Over 140 workers were killed by the lions and the first killer lion was killed on the 9th December.1989 during a hunt dead in the night. <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> is very centrally located for Mzima Springs, the Tsavo River and Tsavo West&rsquo;s spectacular volcanic landscapes. The <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> has an Eco-Tourism Kenya Silver Award and is run on strong eco-tourism principles, arriving at the <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong>, you pull up right outside the reception area and the shop selling local crafts and souvenirs, straight ahead is the main dining area, bar and lounge terrace (well shaded to cope with the area&rsquo;s high temperatures), with bar stools, comfy sofas, and views directly into the bush over the waterhole, There&rsquo;s a firepit nearby, for sundowners or after-dinner drinks, while most Tsavo lodges aim for an elevated point to provide guests with a view of the landscape below, Man Eaters Camp stretches out on the flat plain itself, and the wildlife are all around &ndash; and in &ndash; the Man Eaters Camp you&rsquo;re witness to an unending display of elephants, buffalos, warthogs, giraffe, antelope, and birdlife lured by waterholes, It all makes for a particularly direct and vibrant experience of the bush, Guests at Man Eaters Camp in Tsavo have the choice of tented lode accommodation or solidly constructed cottages, The tents with mosquito screens most of the way round, stand on paved plinths and are suspended beneath steep, makuti-roofed shelters. Solid-walled, hotel-style bathrooms with flush toilets, bidets, washbasin, and white towels and bathrobes, give these facilities a contemporary feel, there are rainfall showers and bathtubs in the tented suites, water at the <strong>Man Eaters Safari Lodge </strong>comes from a spring, with a pumping station and purification system, it&rsquo;s fine to drink, but guests are provided with free bottled water anyway. The bedrooms are furnished simply, but comfortably, with ceiling-to-floor mosquito nets over the beds, and a writing table &ndash; the seating is canvas directors&rsquo; chairs. You can charge batteries in the tents between4.00am and 11.00pm, when the power is on, electricity is provided by two large and two small generators and times can be extended if requested for light or charging batteries, hot water at <strong>Man Eaters Tented Lodge</strong> is supplied by solar panels with power stored in batteries, we also use steam from the generators to heat water (&lsquo;water-heating boilers&rsquo;). The <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> conducts game drives using three, 4x4 safari vehicles and safari vans, although it is in Tsavo national park, daytime game drives are not the only activities you can do at <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong>. The stand-out feature is the very nice swimming pool, although you have the whole of Tsavo West National Park&rsquo;s 7,000km&sup2; to explore &ndash; if you have time &ndash; the Tsavo park&rsquo;s top attraction, Mzima Springs, is just 6km from <strong>Man Eaters Camp.</strong> At the springs, where the car park and nature trail are guarded by rangers, you can watch hippos and crocs disporting themselves in the shallow, crystal-clear waters beneath shady fig trees. There&rsquo;s an underwater viewing tank here, sunk on the lake floor at the end of a short pier. It&rsquo;s not uncommon to see the funny, tiptoe paddling of a hippo, or the sinuous, gliding shape of a croc, and you&rsquo;ll always see the lesser denizens of the springs &ndash; hundreds of large fish, <strong>Tsavo</strong> <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> is adorned with memorable and authentic items that were used during the construction of the railway and most of the facilities here pay homage to the story that is behind the camp&rsquo;s name and its location. The different facilities at the <strong>Tsavo</strong> <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> include a well-stocked bar which serve different types of drinks both local and international drinks including beers, bottled water, cocktails, whiskeys, spirits, soft drinks and wine among others, the bar has clear views of the Tsavo River where animals can easily be spotted as they take a drink to cool off. The restaurant is found in the main building where different meals are served both local and international cuisines. Three meals are served per day that is breakfast, lunch, and dinner and these are served by well-trained staff and prepared by chefs that have a lot of experience in preparing different cuisines. Bush meals (breakfast and dinners) are also available. At <strong>Man Eaters Camp Tsavo - </strong>WIFI is available in all the rooms and around the safari camp to help you keep in touch with your people back home since cell phone service is not all that stable. The <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> also offers honeymoon safari packages, business Centres, meeting places, and conferences depending on the number of guests planning on using the rooms. These are also equipped with the necessary equipment to help with the meetings like projectors, writing material, computers, and furniture among others. If you are looking at booking luxurious rooms at the <strong>Man Eaters Lodge Tsavo</strong> we advise that you book in advance especially during the peak season from June to October when there are large crowds of tourists who throng to the largest National Park in the country to check out the different wildlife species including the big five. <strong>Man Eaters camp</strong> has thirty one luxurious tents that were built in a way to match the African style with grass thatched roofs but still comfortable with a modern touch to suit the needs of the different guests that would wish to spend their safari days at the tented camp. The tents are furnished with an en-suite bathroom that has facilities like a bath/shower with hot and cold water, flushing toilets, private wooden balconies, mosquito nets, terraces, hair dryers, satellite TVs, fire extinguishers, king and queen-sized beds, ceiling fans and clean beddings. There are 8 family tents that are fitted with one single bed for the children, and a double bed. Note that the single bed can easily accommodate an adult, and all the beds have a mosquito net. The <strong>Man Eaters Lodge in Tsavo </strong>also has a tent that is wheelchair friendly, the tents are well-furnished with locally made furniture to blend in with the traditional African setting and they are well-ventilated, the different rooms at the <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> are categorized into single, double, twin, and family rooms that can also act as triple rooms - <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> combination of excellent, hands-on management, harmonious design and architecture and a terrific natural environment has produced an <strong>award winning safari camp</strong> that seems to tick every box without making you feel part of a tourism machine and the bush walks to Mzima Springs are a huge bonus - <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> has matured into one of the most welcoming <strong>safari camps in Kenya,</strong> the herds of impalas, the bull giraffes that wanders around <strong>tented camp</strong>, frequent elephants and lions at the waterhole and a riot of birdlife together create a magical impact on first-time visitors &ndash; and one which doesn&rsquo;t disappoint experienced travelers. Majority of <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> fruits and vegetables &ndash; plus eggs, chicken and honey &ndash; come from their own organic farm, meal service timings are fairly informal or formal allowing for guests&rsquo; individual <strong>Tsavo safari</strong> - Breakfast is always a big buffet, with cereals, fruits, pastries, cold cuts and cheese and cooked breakfast available from the buffet from sausages and bacons with eggs cooked to order. Pancakes and waffles are also available. A typical four-course dinner menu includes starters of: avocado and smoked sailfish timbales, tomato and cucumber salad with sour cream dressing, seafood ragout wrapped in a coriander pancake. There&rsquo;s a choice of soup, for example carrot and ginger, or a consomm&eacute;. The main course might feature a beef fillet with mushrooms, vegetables and saut&eacute;ed potatoes, or fish in an orange curry with rice and vegetables. Dinner always includes hot stone, cook-your-own marinated beef and pork, with dipping sauces and side dishes. &nbsp;Desserts might include banana crumble and custard, pancetta on chunky fruit sauce or a flamb&eacute;ed cr&egrave;me caramel. Lunch is much simpler, and perhaps a reflection of the heartiness of breakfast and dinner, and is a mix of plated and buffet service. A typical menu includes a green salad with a choice of dressings, minestrone soup, a cold meat platter with cold roast beef and chicken, ham, salami and pickles, a pasta dish, burgers or fish goujons, followed by fruit salad or profiteroles. Early meals can be arranged, as can Maasai babysitting and child supervision (although no professional childcare is offered). This is an ad hoc service for an ad hoc fee to be negotiated. <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> makes for relaxed <strong>family safari</strong> with children of all ages, It has baby cots and high chairs with specific children&rsquo;s activities, kids usually have great fun watching impala, baboons and giraffe right by the tents, The staff offers free child minding, there's lots of wildlife around <strong>Man Eaters Lodge in Tsavo </strong>offering plenty of quirky photo opportunities and there are nature walks in tented camp with a naturalist, <br /> Babysitting is available on request (no charge) using housekeeping staff or camp guards. Trained babysitters are not available. <strong>Man Eaters Camp</strong> is a family-friendly safari camp with a relaxed ambience and is a recommended choice for families on family safaris though an enthusiasm for the wildlife and the bush location is always important, with impalaa, baboons and even giraffe right by the tents, it is great fun for kids, Kicking a ball around isn&rsquo;t an option, however, as there is wildlife everywhere. First-aid training has taken place for 91 staff, and is updated every three months. There&rsquo;s a first-aid kit in the safari camp. <strong>Kilaguni Serena Lodge</strong> clinic is 15 minutes&rsquo; drive away. In an emergency, the flying doctors can land at Kilaguni airstrip, less than 15 minutes&rsquo; drive from tented camp. Maasai askaris are on duty day and night, and escort guests around safari camp during the hours of darkness. Every tent has a fire extinguisher. Every corner of the dining area has one too, plus other areas. Fire alarms are installed and fire drills take place every three months for all staff. The rates can change at any time depending on the size of the room and the travel season. Rates tend to go double or triple during the peak season-June to October and a bit lower during the wet season also known as the low season due to the low number of tourists during this period. Below is a list of tentative room rates at the Man Eaters Camp valid till March 2025        </p>

        <h2>Man Eaters Camp bush meals &amp; sundowners</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          There is a somewhat almost primal joy about eating a meal in the raw wilderness of the African savannah, more so if the setting happens to be Tsavo where it is quite possible that your views are framed by stunning landscapes and magnificent wildlife. Special meals are for this reason a popular activity during a <strong>safari in Tsavo</strong> and specific options are listed below</p>
          <p><strong>Picnic Lunch:</strong> Usually arranged during a full day game outing in the Tsavo reserve so that one does not have to go back to the <strong>Man Eaters</strong>, the meal itself is in the form of packed lunch boxes which are provided by the <strong>safari camp</strong> by prior arrangement the night before to allow them adequate time to prepare the meal boxes. Though the meal itself is typically simple though satisfying, the often-scenic setting in the wild makes this a truly memorable meal</p>
          <p><strong>Bush Breakfast &amp; Dinners:</strong> A more elaborate meal and in the case of a Bush dinner, this could also be an event in itself around a bonfire with entertainment such as light music or tribal dance performances. Bush meals are arranged at special designated sites within Tsavo and these are generally located outside of but far from the camp, Menus can range from multi-course fine cuisine to more casual bush barbeque meals, prices for these special meals vary widely starting from USD 60 per person all the way to + USD 100 per person for more luxurious bush meals</p>
          <p><strong>Sundowners:</strong> Ending your day on Safari to Tsavo with your favorite drink in hand, the company of friends or loved ones and a gorgeous sunset unfolding right before your eyes is a very special experience indeed and recognizing this, Bush meals in Tsavo can also be organised for a variety of group sizes including those planning on going for their <strong>Honeymoon in Tsavo</strong> and may also cater for certain special dietary requirements such as gluten free, vegan, vegetarian and even restricted vegetarian such as for Indian Jain diets which exclude use of Onions or Garlic as ingredients. Though choices are limited for bush meals, in-house dining at the lodges or camps promises more dietary options. Contact us in case you require specific information on cuisine and dining in Tsavo

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
The cornerstone of a <strong>safari to Tsavo</strong> experience is that each group has their own<strong> open-top safari vehicle</strong>, and their own dedicated <strong>safari guide </strong>and spotter.

        <h2>Tsavo West National Park</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
<strong>Tsavo West National Park</strong> along with her sister <strong>Tsavo East National Park</strong> form Kenya&rsquo;s biggest park, they were gazetted in 1948 and were once a mega park until they were divided by the <strong>Nairobi Mombasa</strong> Highway and the railway line that runs alongside it. Of the two, <strong>Tsavo East National Park</strong> is the largest national park and interestingly the parks have distinct ecosystems. <strong>Tsavo East National Park</strong> is a generally flat, harsh and harsh open landscape dotted with humongous Baobab trees, low trees, and bushes. The banks of the <strong>Galana River</strong> and the Aruba Dam attract many animals and birds that come to quench their thirst. <strong>Tsavo West National Park</strong> is one of the largest national parks in Kenya covering an area of 9065 sq km. Combined with <strong>Tsavo East national park</strong>, they together form one of the largest game parks in the world. The <strong>Tsavo West National Park</strong> is sometimes referred to as the land of the <strong>man eaters</strong>, because of lions that killed several workers constructing the railway that was passing through Tsavo during the time of British rule in late 19th century. A movie called the Ghost and the darkness has been shot to reenact the events. The <strong>Tsavo West National Park</strong> is semi-arid and the landscape includes open plains, savannah bush, semi-desert scrub, acacia woodlands, numerous rocky ridges and outcrops and riverine vegetation. Other features are hilly environment, dotted volcanic cones and extinct black lava flow. Regarding the weather, <strong>Tsavo West National Park</strong> is normally hot and arid. Day temperature is around 29&deg;C/84&deg;F and at night, it averages 18&deg;C/64&deg;F. It has two period for rainfall which is long rains in March, April, May and short rains in October November and December. The majority of visitors to Tsavo West are on short road trips from Mombasa, Malindi, Diani or Watamu to the area&rsquo;s lodges. A <strong>Tsavo West safari</strong> would normally include two or three nights at one of the four main safari camps in the Developed Area. Unlike <strong>Tsavo East safaris</strong>, however, you&rsquo;re not restricted to road access (or flying in by quite expensive chartered light aircraft) as there are two main airstrips that are frequently used by the scheduled safari domestic airlines, either as part of longer safari incorporating some of Kenya&rsquo;s other parks, or as a stand-alone <strong>Kenya safaris </strong>add-on, either from Nairobi or from Mombasa. &nbsp;It takes about 5 to 6 hrs to get to Tsavo West National Park by road. The park has five gates and they are Mtito Andei gate which is the main gate, Tsavo gate, Lake Jipe gate, Maktau South gate, Maktau North gate. Roads in the reserve are fairly good and can be traversed by 2-wheel drive vehicles although they can be a challenge in the wet season and 4-wheel drive vehicle will be do better. It is also possible to get the park by flight. 6 airstrips exist which can be used. They are Lake Jipe airstrip, Kamboya airstrip, Kasigau gate airstip, Kilaguni airstrip, finch Hatton airstrip and Maktau airstrip depending on your location in the park. Birdlife is prolific with over 400 species. It is located along the busy avian migration which encourages bird ringers (tagging) to make an annual pilgrimage to the park. There are plenty of animals in Tsavo West national park. It is home to the big five and other types of animals which include, hippos, lions, cheetah, leopards, buffalos, masai giraffe, bush baby among many other varieties. There is a drive through rhino sanctuary which enhances the chances of sporting the very elusive black rhino. Other attractions include the poachers lookout where you view the animals below and also see Mt Kilimanjaro on a clear day. Another main attraction is the <strong>Mzima Springs</strong>, where sparkling crystal-clear springs are home to hippo and crocodile that can be watched from an underground lookout

<h2>The man eaters of Tsavo </h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
  <strong>The man eaters of Tsavo</strong> is a legend that continues to capture the imagination. The building of a railway line through deepest Africa would never be easy, the line from <strong>Nairobi to Mombasa</strong> passed through the great plains of Tsavo and a bridge would have to be built across the <strong>Tsavo River</strong>. Out of the wilderness a threat emerged which would take 9 months to quell. Two huge male Lions apparently began to attack and drag off many of the bridge workers while they slept at night in their tents. This continued from March through to December despite preventative measures being put in place and the setting of traps. Many workers actually fled at this time and the building process was halted. <strong>Lt. Col John Patterson,</strong> the leader of the building project eventually shot and killed both Lions after months of failed attempts. The reconstructed remains of these mane-less Lions are on permanent display in the Chicago Field Museum. Patterson published a book about it in 1907 called <strong>'The Man-Eaters of Tsavo'</strong>. Three movies were made about this story with the most recent being 'The <strong>Ghost and the Darkness'</strong> which starred Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas. It is not known for sure how many people died in the Lion attacks, conflicting numbers given by Patterson have not helped matters but it could be more than 100 or less than 40 depending on which report you follow
